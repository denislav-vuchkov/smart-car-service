# Final Project - SmartGarage (April 22)

**Project Description:** 
- SmartGarage is a web application that enables the owners of an auto repair shop
to manage their day-to-day job. New customer walks in the shop and explains what 
the issue is with his vehicle and an employee creates a new personal vehicle in the application.
When the shop visit is created the employee creates a new user, new
 vehicle, and adds the services that will be performed on the car (oil change, brake fluid changeâ€¦). The new customer receives
 email, that contains information about his automatically generated login information and a separate one with their password.
 Both customers and employees can generate reports for a visit/s in one of 25 currencies which is generated in the backend
 as PDF and sent to their email. 
- At the end of the project we started integration of online card payments.
